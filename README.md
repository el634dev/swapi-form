## Features
List of features here:
- Users can serach and sumbit data through a form and by entering a number
- Users can see two different web pages, the home page where the form is displayed and the results page where the results is displayed

## Setup
The requirements for this project are simple and do not require much setup. You will need a code editor of your choice. I use VSCode because HTML, CSS, and Flask are supported, which makes setup easier. There are no dependencies, only additional plugins if you would like to set them up. If you are unsure, then I would say Prettier+ is a good start. You can get all the plugins in VSCode in the side menu, it looks like blocks. You can add the Star Wars API or SWAPI which you can find by searching for it in your browser. To sum everything up, all you need is a code editor.

## Usage
How does one go about using it?
`User navigates onto the home page and can enter a number where prompted and then click submit.`
`After clicking sumbit the user is taken to a second page where the data is displayed.`

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
